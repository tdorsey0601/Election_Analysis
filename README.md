# Election_Analysis
module 3 election
Project Overview
The Board of Elections employee gave us the task to complete an election audit for a recent local congressional election. We are going to calculate the number of votes cast for each candidate and county, get the complete list of candidates who received votes, get the list of counties that voted, calculate the total number of votes each candidate received, calculate the total number of votes from each county and the percentage of votes each candidate won. Calculate the percentage of the votes from each county, determine the winner based on popular vote and determine the county which had the most votes.
